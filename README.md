# Crisis Text Analysis for Targeted Aid Distribution

This project aims to support humanitarian organizations in better responding to crises by analyzing text data and extracting actionable insights. By applying machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the project helps classify incoming messages based on urgency and content, allowing for more effective aid distribution.

##  Project Overview
The project focuses on processing and classifying crisis-related text data using NLP models like TF-IDF, logistic regression, and others. The goal is to create a model that can help organizations prioritize messages and respond quickly to urgent needs.

## Features
- Text Preprocessing: Tokenization, stemming, and removing stop words to clean text data.
- Text Classification: Using machine learning algorithms to classify messages based on urgency and content.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

## Technologies Used
- Python: Core programming language
- NLP Libraries: `nltk`, `scikit-learn`
- Pandas & NumPy: Data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib: Data visualization
