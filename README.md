# Crisis-Text-Analysis-for-Targeted-Aid-Distribution-

Project Overview

This project aims to enhance disaster response efficiency by leveraging advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to analyze and categorize text messages from individuals affected by disasters. The system is designed to automate the identification of urgent needs such as food, water, shelter, and medical aid, thereby improving response times and ensuring better resource allocation.

Objectives

Automate Text Classification: Develop a system to automatically classify text messages based on urgent needs.
Improve Response Times: Enable faster identification and response to critical needs.
Optimize Resource Allocation: Ensure that aid resources are distributed effectively to those in need.
Enhance Situational Awareness: Provide real-time insights to disaster response teams.
